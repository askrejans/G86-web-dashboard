# React Dashboard for Speeduino/GPS Testing

This project serves as a quick and dirty web dashboard in React.js for testing Speeduino/GPS gauges using data from MQTT. It is specifically designed to work with [gps-to-mqtt](https://github.com/askrejans/gps-to-mqtt) and [speeduino-to-mqtt](https://github.com/askrejans/speeduino-to-mqtt) projects.

### How It Works

- **Data Sources:**
  - [gps-to-mqtt](https://github.com/askrejans/gps-to-mqtt): Provides GPS data over MQTT.
  - [speeduino-to-mqtt](https://github.com/askrejans/speeduino-to-mqtt): Sends Speeduino gauge data over MQTT.

- **Testing Setup:**
  - This React dashboard allows you to visualize and test Speeduino and GPS gauges simultaneously by fetching and displaying data from the mentioned MQTT sources.

- **Usage:**
  - To set up the testing environment, follow the instructions provided in the documentation of [gps-to-mqtt](https://github.com/askrejans/gps-to-mqtt) and [speeduino-to-mqtt](https://github.com/askrejans/speeduino-to-mqtt).

This project utilizes [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for quick and easy bootstrapping of React applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when changes are made, and lint errors can be viewed in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance, including minifying and hashing filenames. The resulting app is ready for deployment. Learn more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).


## Pre-Built Packages

There are also pre build packages, that combines three individual components: [Speeduino-to-MQTT](https://github.com/askrejans/speeduino-to-mqtt), [GPS-to-MQTT](https://github.com/askrejans/gps-to-mqtt), and [G86 Web Dashboard](https://github.com/askrejans/G86-web-dashboard) in one system with predefined services.

You can quickly get started by using pre-built packages available for both x64 and Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM) architectures:

- **DEB Packages for x64:** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/deb/pool/main/amd64/g86-car-telemetry_1.0.deb)
- **DEB Packages for Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM):** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/deb/pool/main/aarch64/g86-car-telemetry_1.0.deb)
- **RPM Packages for x64:** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/rpm/x86_64/g86-car-telemetry-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm)
- **RPM Packages for Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM):** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/rpm/aarch64/g86-car-telemetry-1.0-1.aarch64.rpm)

### Package Installation Details

- All packages install the three services in the directory `/opt/g86-car-telemetry` (or `/usr/opt/g86-car-telemetry`).
- Configuration files for GPS and ECU processors can be found under `/etc/g86-car-telemetry` (or `/usr/etc/g86-car-telemetry`).
- Web project configurations are located in `/var/www/g86-car-telemetry/config` (or `/usr/var/www/g86-car-telemetry/config`).
- Ensure to add relevant configurations for MQTT server, TTY ports, and any extra settings.

### Installed Services

The packages automatically install and manage the following services:

- `g86-car-telemetry-gps`
- `g86-car-telemetry-speeduino`
- `g86-car-telemetry-web`

### Compatibility and Testing

These packages have been tested on both Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM) with DEB packages and x86 systems with RPM packages. However, please note that this project is a work in progress, and more tests are needed, especially with real ECUs. Exercise caution when using, and stay tuned for updates as development continues to enhance and stabilize the functionality.
